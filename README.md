# Chess GUI
This is a static website where you can play against the Stockfish chess engine. I made this just to be able to fine-tune the engine parameters for a human-like play.

Hosted at: https://chessgui.netlify.app

## Features
- Customize all engine options (search depth, skill, play style...)
- Play as both sides
- Undo moves
- Export the game as PGN (tested with lichess game import)
